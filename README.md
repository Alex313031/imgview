# JPEGView - Image Viewer and Editor


# FORK info

I've FORKed this repo from SourceForge, as this excellent project by David Kleiner could use some updates.  I'm hoping some users will make suggestions, and devs will do pull requests on this project as it'll be a learning curve for me to pick it up. -sylikc

I'll first start with merging patches and making updates ... and getting the environment to compile ;) .  I'll make a first release which matches the last release from SF ... but it'll take awhile to get the CI/CD stuff right.


# Original from SF

https://sourceforge.net/projects/jpegview/

Features
* Small and fast, uses SSE2 and up to 4 CPU cores
* High quality resampling filter, preserving sharpness of images
* Basic image processing tools can be applied realtime during viewing
